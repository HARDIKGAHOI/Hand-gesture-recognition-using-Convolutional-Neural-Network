-> Hand Gesture Recognition with CNN

This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand gestures from grayscale images.  
It was developed as part of a machine learning assignment to classify American Sign Language (ASL) letters.

-> Features
- Image preprocessing and visualization
- Custom CNN architecture using Keras and TensorFlow
- Model training and evaluation
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
- Performance metrics and plots

-> How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HARDIKGAHOI/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open and run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook hand_gesture_recognition.ipynb
```

->Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of ASL hand gestures represented as 28Ã—28 grayscale images.  
*Note: you may need to download or link your dataset separately if it's not included.*
